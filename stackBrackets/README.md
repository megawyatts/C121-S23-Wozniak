Desc: Two classes that test if an array of brackets, and parenthesis are balanced, by pushing or popping
values, and at the end of the tests if there is anything left in the stack, the method prints "unbalanced."

The most difficult part of this assignemnt was figuring out how the methods would acknowledge an unbalanced bracket
that started unbalanced, but to write in an effcient way that would not increase the Big O time.
