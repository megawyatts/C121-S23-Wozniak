Desc: This activity was to test inheritence comprehension. I created a parent class of "Podcast" with daughter classes of "Fiction Podcast" and "Nonfiction Podcast",
along with getters and setters in each class to gurantee the desired variables could be retrieved. 

The most difficult part of this activity was understanding the Overrides, along with which Variables were passed down from parent to child class.
