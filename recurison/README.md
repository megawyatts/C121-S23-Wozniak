Desc: A recurison test that counts the number of "s"'s in an array, and recalls a counter consistently to
add up the number of "s"'s. Was built to test comprehension of recursion.

The most difficult part definitely ended up being understanding and following along with the recurison,
especially with all of the method calls.
